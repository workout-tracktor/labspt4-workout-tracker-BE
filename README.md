## Welcome

This is the home of the webpt4 Labs team backend codebase for the 'Workout-Tracker' product at Lambda School. I'm glad you are here because there's some things you should know:

Firstly, this database is hosted on heroku. So if you need the credentials to get into the hosted server (incoming labs team) please get in touch with one of us on slack. (Our information can be found in the Support section of this readme.)

Secondly, I hope you have had a great day so far.

That's it! Enjoy your stay.

## How to set up postgres database

1. Login into PgAdmin 4 and create a new database under PostgreSQL (default username is postgres). You can also
make a new user instead of postgres through Postgres's command line tools

2. After running yarn, create a .env in the root of the project with these variables 

    * DB_NAME => this is the name of the database you created
    * DB_USER => Your postgres username. The default is postgres
    * DB_PASSWORD => The password for your postgres username
    * DB_ENV => This is your environment (development, staging and production). By default, your envionment will be development

3. Run knex migrate:latest, knex seed:run. Your database should be run and running
